# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using GANs

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of a credit card fraud detection system by addressing the problem of data imbalance. In real-world financial datasets, fraudulent transactions are much fewer compared to legitimate ones, which makes it difficult for machine learning models to perform well.

To solve this, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate synthetic fraudulent transaction data. These generated samples help balance the dataset and improve the performance of a binary classification model.

This project is based on a Coursera Guided Project.
